## Summary
Made this simple chat application to practice socket.io. I will be trying to replicate Slack's functionality. This project's sole purpose is to practice socket.io.

Tools used in this project:
* Jquery - for fast animation
* Socket.io - for centralized server
* nodemon - automatically restarts server when file(s) change
